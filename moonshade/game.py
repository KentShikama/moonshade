#  - change the population of trees
#  - change the available pool
#  - change the reserve pool

# we have input (button.. +text? ) that executes whatever.

# This can at first look just like this terminal output, but better.
# Easy to make the text board have nice size, spacing, and color

Making a gui?
Also the lists of VP tokens.
Also, when determining moves,
print the ascii board with colors!!! and dot sizes?
